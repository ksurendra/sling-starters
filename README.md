# sling-starters
Pre-built code using Apache Sling Maven Archetypes for developers to get started quickly

# Modules

The project is organized in two main groups

## Modules with PreBuilt code 

These are quick starters that you may clone/download thes folders, build and deploy them directly to Apache Sling. You may also extend them by adding mire functionality.

* [Sling HTML5 Boilerpalte (sling-html5boilerplate)]()
* [Sling HTML5UP (sling-html5up)]()
* [Sling Multisite (sling-multisite)](https://github.com/ksurendra/sling-starters/tree/master/sling-multisite/slingmultisite)
* [Sling Webapp (sling-webapp)]() 

Please refer to individual modules' README file for installation and usage details.

## Archetypes

These are for more advanced users. Archetypes allow us to build a specific project structure 

* [Multimodule](https://github.com/ksurendra/sling-starters/tree/master/sling-maven-archetypes/multimodule)

The above are an extension of the [maven archetypes](http://sling.apache.org/site/maven-archetypes.html) provided by Apache Sling. You may also [check the codebase](http://sling.apache.org/site/maven-archetypes.html) of these archetypes.
